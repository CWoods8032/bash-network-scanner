# Network Port Scanner and Report Generator

## Overview
This Bash Scripting project is designed to perform live network scans using the command 'nmap', capture open ports and running services, and generate a readable security report. It automates the process to help identify potential risks in networked devices.

## Purpose / Learning Objectives
This project was developed as part of a Bash scripting class. It focuses on:
1. Fundamentals of shell scripting
2. Use of external command-line tools like 'nmap'
3. Best practices in scripting
4. Enhancing awareness of network and device security

## Current Status
Initial setup is complete. The script currently supports:
1. Argument validation
2. Live 'nmap' port scanning using the '-sV' flag
3. Report generation including open ports and static vulnerability info

## Future Goals
1. Integrate real CVE vulnerability mapping
2. Implementing a local vulnerability analysis
3. API Integration
